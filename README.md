# Fake Product Review Detection Using Machine Learning

I am excited to share one of my latest works in Machine Learning: implementing and extending the *Fake Product Review Detection Using Machine Learning* paper published by Springer, along with additional experiments.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explored the challenge of detecting deceptive or fake product reviews using various machine learning techniques. The implementation includes comprehensive experiments aimed at improving upon the original research.

## Techniques Applied

1. **Data Balance Analysis (Count Plot):** Analyzed data distribution to ensure balanced classes, which is critical for accurate model performance.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Punctuation removal
   - Stopword elimination
   - Word embedding
   - Data standardization

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Logistic Regression
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Naive Bayes

4. **Model Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## Experiments

I trained all models on 80% of the dataset and tested them on the remaining 20%. Experiments were conducted with and without data standardization to analyze its impact on model performance.

## Results

After rigorous testing, the Logistic Regression model outperformed all other models, achieving an impressive 88% accuracy, which aligns with the results reported in the original research paper.
